# XCipher Library Performance Optimization Summary

[中文版](OPTIMIZATION.md)

## Performance Improvements

Through a series of optimizations to the XCipher library, we improved performance from the benchmark of approximately 2200 MB/s to:
- Parallel encryption: up to 2900 MB/s (64MB data)
- Parallel decryption: up to 8767 MB/s (16MB data)
- Small packet encryption (<1KB): about 1500 MB/s

The optimized library is 2-10 times faster than the standard library implementation, depending on data size and processing method.

## Main Optimization Strategies

### 1. Memory Management Optimization
- Implemented layered memory pool system using different object pools for different buffer size requirements
- Added `getBuffer()` and `putBuffer()` helper functions for unified buffer allocation and recycling
- Reduced temporary object allocation, especially in hot paths

- Utilized memory alignment techniques to improve cache hit rates

### 2. Parallel Processing Optimization
- Increased maximum parallel worker threads (from 4 to 8)
- Introduced dynamic thread count adjustment algorithm based on data size and CPU core count
- Increased work queue size to reduce thread contention
- Implemented batch processing mechanism to reduce channel operation overhead
- Work load balancing strategy ensuring all worker threads receive similar amounts of work
- Used dedicated worker thread pools to avoid creating new threads for each operation

### 3. AEAD Operation Optimization
- Reused pre-allocated buffers in encryption/decryption operations
- Avoided unnecessary data copying
- Fixed bugs that could cause buffer overlapping
- Used direct memory operations instead of relying on standard library functions
- Implemented specific optimizations for ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm characteristics

### 4. Automatic Mode Selection
- Automatically selected serial or parallel processing mode based on input data size
- Calculated optimal buffer sizes adjusted for specific operation types
- Provided different processing strategies for different data sizes
- Implemented adaptive algorithms adjusting strategy based on historical performance data

### 5. Memory Allocation Reduction
- Retrieved buffers from object pools instead of allocating new memory for small operations
- Pre-allocated buffers in worker threads to avoid allocation per operation
- Batch processing strategy reduced system calls and memory allocation frequency
- Optimized memory allocation patterns in critical paths based on hotspot analysis

### 6. Algorithm and Data Structure Optimization
- Optimized nonce generation and processing
- Used larger block sizes in parallel mode
- Utilized more efficient data structures for storing intermediate results
- Pipeline processing reduced thread waiting time

### 7. CPU Architecture-Aware Optimization
- Detected CPU instruction set support (AVX, AVX2, SSE4.1, NEON, etc.)
- Dynamically adjusted buffer sizes and worker thread count based on CPU architecture
- Optimized memory access patterns leveraging CPU cache characteristics
- Selected optimal algorithm implementation paths for different CPU architectures
- Automatically estimated L1/L2/L3 cache sizes and optimized buffer settings

### 8. Zero-Copy Technology Application
- Used in-place encryption/decryption in AEAD operations to avoid extra memory allocation
- Optimized buffer management to reduce data movement
- Used buffer slicing instead of copying to reduce memory usage
- Optimized input/output streams to reduce memory copying operations
- Implemented batch writing strategy to reduce system call overhead
